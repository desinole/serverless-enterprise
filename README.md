# Beyond Quickstarts: Enterprise Challenges and Solutions for Azure Serverless
You have heard of the limitless possibilities of serverless. But what happens when you have to ... ummm ... limit your serverless resources? Welcome to enterprise environments where anything that can, shall be limited, and in most cases for valid reasons too. Join us for an entertaining talk that will take you beyond the typical quickstart serverless samples and into the real world of deploying Azure serverless technologies in enterprise environments. We'll share valuable lessons learned, exploring everything from scaling restrictions to private networks to handling managed resources and connections. Our focus will be on popular Azure resources like Functions and Logic Apps, but we'll touch on a variety of other Azure services as well. By the end of this talk, you'll have a newfound appreciation for the practical considerations involved in successful enterprise deployments of serverless technologies.
